# Yet Another LeetCode Timer

There are a few of these out there but none that I was really satisfied with. [LeetPlug](https://leetplug.azurewebsites.net/) seemed promising but the server taking data is no longer in service so as a record for viewing progress, it's not super useful.

I used [LeetCode Timer Tracker] for a while, but I wanted something that felt integrated into LeetCode like how LeetPlug functioned.

### Requirements
1. Integrated into the page
  - starts when you either click start or you first start typing.
  - visible, but not distracting
  - stops once you have a successful submission
2. Local Data Storage
  - LeetPlug probably had interesting potential for aggregated data views, but ultimately the owner had to maintain and pay for a web server and the setup & email verification process felt like unnecessary work for someone that just wants to quickly pick it up and run with it.
3. Exportable
  - Excel sheets could be fun. Until data viz is built into this, I'll use excel or google sheets easily.
